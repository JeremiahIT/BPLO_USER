üìä Your Data Structure
Your system has these main tables:
users - User accounts
business_permits - Main permit data
business_activities - Business activities
requirements - Document requirements
regions/provinces/cities/barangays - Location data
Would you like me to help you set up any of these platforms specifically? I can guide you through the deployment process or help you configure local tools for data viewing.
